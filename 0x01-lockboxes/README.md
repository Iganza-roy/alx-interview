# Lockboxes

This directory contains the solution for the lockboxes project.

I was required to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened.

Here are the specifications:

```
Creating a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

Prototype: def canUnlockAll(boxes)
boxes is a list of lists
A key with the same number as a box opens that box
Assuming all keys will be positive integers
There can be keys that do not have boxes
The first box boxes[0] is unlocked
Return True if all boxes can be opened, else return False
```
